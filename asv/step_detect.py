Regression detection in ASV is based on detecting stepwise changes in
the graphs. The assumptions on the data are as follows: the curves are
piecewise constant plus random noise. We don't know the variance of
the noise nor the scaling of the data, but we assume the noise
amplitude is constant in time.

Luckily, step detection is a well-studied problem. In this
implementation, we mainly follow a variant of the approach outlined in
[Friedrich2008]_. This provides a fast algorithm for solving the piecewise
fitting problem

.. math::
   :label: gamma-opt

   \mathop{\mathrm{argmin}}_{k,\{j\},\{\mu\}} \gamma k + \sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{i=j_{r-1}}^{j_r} |y_i - \mu_r|

The differences are: as we do not need exact solutions, we add
additional heuristics to work around the :math:`{\mathcal O}(n^2)`
scaling, which is too harsh for pure-Python code. For details, see
``asv.step_detect.solve_potts_approx``.  Moreover, we follow a
slightly different approach on obtaining a suitable number of
intervals, by selecting an optimal value for :math:`\gamma`, based on
a variant of the information criterion problem mentioned in
[Friedrich2008]_

Bayesian information
--------------------

To proceed, we need an argument by which to select a suitable
:math:`\gamma` in :eq:`gamma-opt`. Some of the literature on step
detection, e.g. [Yao1988]_, suggests results based on Schwarz information
criteria,

.. math::
   :label: ic-form

   \text{SC} = \frac{m}{2} \ln \sigma^2 + k \log m = \text{min!}

where :math:`\sigma^2` is maximum likelihood variance estimator for
gaussian noise. For the implementation, see
``asv.step_detect.solve_potts_autogamma``.

What follows is a handwaving plausibility argument why such an
objective function makes sense, and how to end up with :math:`l_1`
rather than gaussians. Better approaches are probably to be found in
step detection literature.  If you have a better formulation,
contributions/corrections are welcome!

We assume a Bayesian model:

.. math::
   :label:

   P(\{y_i\}_{i=1}^m|\sigma,k,\{\mu_i\}_{i=1}^k,\{j_i\}_{i=1}^{k-1})
   =
   N
   \sigma^{-m}
   \exp(
   -\sigma^{-1}\sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{i=j_{r-1}+1}^{j_r} |y_i - \mu_r|
   )

Here, :math:`y_i` are the :math:`m` data points at hand, :math:`k` is
the number of intervals, :math:`\mu_i` are the values of the function
at the intervals, :math:`j_i` are the interval breakpoints;
:math:`j_0=0`, :math:`j_k=m`, :math:`j_{r-1}<j_r`. The noise is
assumed exponential rather than gaussian, which results to the more
robust :math:`l_1` norm fitting rather than :math:`l_2`.  The noise
amplitude :math:`\sigma` is not known.
:math:`N` is a normalization constant that depends on :math:`m` but
not on the other parameters.

The optimal :math:`k` comes from Bayesian reasoning:
:math:`\hat{k} = \mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}_k P(k|\{y\})`, where

.. math::
   :label:

   P(k|\{y\}) = \frac{\pi(k)}{\pi(\{y\})}\int d\sigma (d\mu)^k \sum_{\{j\}}
   P(\{y\}|\sigma,k,\{\mu\},\{j\}) \pi(\sigma, \{\mu\},\{j\}|k)

The prior :math:`\pi(\{y\})` does not matter for :math:`\hat{k}`; the
other priors are assumed flat. We would need to estimate the behavior
of the integral in the limit :math:`m\to\infty`.  We do not succeed in
doing this rigorously here, although it might be done in the literature.

Consider first saddle-point integration over :math:`\{\mu\}`,
expanding around the max-likelihood values :math:`\mu_r^*`.
The max-likelihood estimates are medians of the data points in each interval.
Change in the exponent when :math:`\mu` is perturbed is

.. math::
   :label:

   \Delta = -\sigma^{-1}\sum_{r=1}^k \sum_{i=j_{r-1}+1}^{j_r}[|y_i-\mu^*_r - \delta\mu_r| - |y_i-\mu^*_r|]

Note that :math:`\sum_{i=j_{r-1}+1}^{j_r}
\mathrm{sgn}(y_i-\mu^*_r)=0`, so that response to small variations
:math:`\delta\mu_r` is :math:`m`-independent. For larger variations, we have

.. math::
   :label:

   \Delta = -\sigma^{-1}\sum_{r=1}^k N_r(\delta \mu_r) |\delta \mu_r|

where :math:`N_r(\delta\mu)=|\#\text{above}-\#\text{below}|` is the
difference in the number of points in the interval above vs. below the
perturbed median. Let us assume that in a typical case,
:math:`N_r(\delta\mu)\sim{}m_r\delta\mu/\sigma` where :math:`m_r` is
the number of points in the interval. This recovers a result we would
have obtained in the gaussian noise case

.. math::
   :label:

   \Delta \sim -\sigma^{-2} \sum_r m_r |\delta \mu_r|^2

For the gaussian case, this would not have required any questionable assumptions.
After integration over :math:`\{\delta\mu\}` we are left with

.. math::
   :label:

   \int(\ldots)
   \propto
   \int d\sigma \sum_{\{j\}}
   (2\pi)^{k/2}\sigma^k [m_1\cdots m_k]^{-1/2}
   P(\{y\}|\sigma,k,\{\mu_*\},\{j\})
   \pi(\sigma, \{j\}|k)

We now approximate the rest of the integrals/sums with only the
max-likelihood terms, and assume :math:`m_j^*\sim{}m/k`. Then,

.. math::
   :label:

   \ln P(k|\{y\})
   &\simeq
   C_1(m) + C_2(k)
   +
   \frac{k}{2}\ln(2\pi) + k \ln \sigma_* - \frac{k}{2}\ln(m/k)
   +
   \ln P(\{y\}|\sigma_*,k,\{\mu_*\},\{j_*\})
   \\
   &\approx
   \tilde{C}_1(m) + \tilde{C}_2(k)
   -
   \frac{k}{2} \ln m
   +
   \ln P(\{y\}|\sigma_*,k,\{\mu_*\},\{j_*\})

where we neglect terms that don't affect asymptotics for
:math:`m\to\infty`, and :math:`C` are some constants not depending on
both :math:`m, k`. The result is of course the Schwarz criterion for
:math:`k` free model parameters. We can suspect that the factor
:math:`k/2` should be replaced by a different number, since we have
:math:`2k` parameters. If also the other integrals/sums can be 
approximated in the same way as the :math:`\{\mu\}` ones, we should
obtain the missing part.

Substituting in the max-likelihood value

.. math::
   :label:

    \sigma_* = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{i=j_{r-1}^*+1}^{j_r^*} |y_i - \mu_r^*|

we get

.. math::
   :label:

   \ln P(k|\{y\})
   \sim
   C
   -
   \frac{k}{2} \log m
   -
   m \ln\sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{i=j_{r-1}^*}^{j_r^*} |y_i - \mu_r^*|

This is now similar to :eq:`ic-form`, apart from numerical prefactors. The
final fitting problem then becomes

.. math::
   :label: bic-form

   \mathop{\mathrm{argmin}}_{k,\{j\},\{\mu\}} r(m) k + \ln\sum_{r=1}^k\sum_{i=j_{r-1}}^{j_r} |y_i - \mu_r|

with :math:`r(m) = \frac{\log m}{2m}`. As we know this function
:math:`r(m)` is not necessarily completely correct, and it seems doing
the calculation rigorously requires more effort than can be justified
by the requirements of the application, we now take a pragmatic view and
fudge the function to :math:`r(m) = \beta \frac{\log m}{m}` with
:math:`\beta` chosen so that things appear to work in practice
for the problem at hand.

According to [Friedrich2008]_, problem :eq:`bic-form` can be solved in
:math:`{\cal O}(n^3)` time.  This is too slow, however. We can however
approach this on the basis of the easier problem :eq:`gamma-opt`.  It
produces a family of solutions :math:`[k^*(\gamma), \{\mu^*(\gamma)\},
\{j^*(\gamma)\}]`.  We now evaluate :eq:`bic-form` restricted to the
curve parameterized by :math:`\gamma`.  In particular,
:math:`[\{\mu^*(\gamma)\}, \{j^*(\gamma)\}]` solves :eq:`bic-form`
under the constraint :math:`k=k^*(\gamma)`. If :math:`k^*(\gamma)`
obtains all values in the set :math:`\{1,\ldots,m\}` when
:math:`\gamma` is varied, the original problem is solved
completely. This probably is not a far-fetched assumption; in practice
it appears such Bayesian information criterion provides a reasonable
way for selecting a suitable :math:`\gamma`.

    We do not use here an approach that has asymptotically optimal
    performance; at least O(n**2 * log(n)) would be achievable, whereas
    we have here O(n**3).  The asymptotic performance does not matter
    for solve_potts_approx, which only looks at small windows of the

    prefactors, which for Python means minimal code.
