Installing airspeed velocity
============================

**airspeed velocity** is known to work on Linux, Mac OS-X, and Windows.
It is known to work with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.
It works also with PyPy.

**airspeed velocity** is a standard Python package, with its
installation based on ``setuptools``, and can be installed using::

    python setup.py install

The requirements should be automatically installed.  If they aren't
installed automatically, for example due to networking restrictions,
the requirements are:

- `six <http://pythonhosted.org/six/>`__, 1.4 or later

One of the following:

- `virtualenv <http://virtualenv.org/>`__, 1.10 or later, for Python
  2.6, 2.7, and 3.2 (starting from Python 3.3, the builtin ``venv``
  module is used; however, if you want to include earlier Pythons in
  your benchmark, then the *master* Python, i.e. the one which is
  running asv, still needs virtualenv).

  Note that virtualenv 1.11.0 will not work, as it contains a bug in
  setuptools that prevents its installation in a clean virtual
  environment.

- An `anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`__ or
  `miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`__
  installation, with the ``conda`` command available on your path.

.. note::

   Anaconda or miniconda is preferred if the dependencies of your
   project involve a lot of compiled C/C++ extensions and are
   available in the ``conda`` repository, since ``conda`` will be able
   to fetch precompiled binaries for these dependencies in many cases.
   Using ``virtualenv``, these dependencies will have to be compiled
   every time the environments are set up.

Optional optimization
---------------------

If your project being benchmarked contains C, C++, Objective-C or
Cython, consider installing ``ccache``.  `ccache
<https://ccache.samba.org/>`__ is a compiler cache that speeds up
compilation time when the same objects are repeatedly compiled.  In
**airspeed velocity**, the project being benchmarked is recompiled at
many different points in its history, often with only minor changes to
the source code, so ``ccache`` can help speed up the total benchmarking
time considerably.

Running the self-tests
----------------------

The self tests are based on `py.test <http://pytest.org/>`__.  If you
don't have it installed, and you have a connection to the Internet, it
will be installed automatically.

To run **airspeed velocity**'s self tests::

    python setup.py test

.. todo::
    Checking out from git/tarball/PyPI  etc.
