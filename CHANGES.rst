0.6 (TBD)
---------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^
- ``asv run`` and ``asv continuous`` don't implement the ``--strict`` option anymore,
  and they will always return a non-zero (i.e. ``2``) exit status if any benchmark fail.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

Other Changes and Additions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.5.1 (2021-02-06)
------------------

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
- Packaging ``requirements-dev.txt`` file, used in ``setup.py``. (#1013)

0.5 (2021-02-05)
----------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Adding environment variables to build and benchmark commands. (#809, #833)
- Added ``--strict`` option to ``asv run`` to set exit code on failure. (#865)
- Added ``--no-stats`` option to ``asv compare`` and ``asv continuous``. (#879)
- Added ``--durations`` option to ``asv run`` and ``asv show`` for displaying
  benchmark run durations. (#838)
- Added ``--date-period`` option to ``asv run`` for running benchmarks for
  commits separated by a constant time interval. (#835)
- Web UI button to group regressions by benchmark. (#869)
- Space-saving v2 file format for storing results. (#847)
- ``timeraw_*`` benchmarks for measuring e.g. import times. (#832)
- Support for using conda environment files for env setup. (#793)

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^
- Results file format change requires ``asv update`` to update old data
  to v2 format.
- The configuration syntax for "matrix", "exclude", and "include"
  in ``asv.conf.json`` has changed. The old syntax is still supported,
  unless you are installing packages named ``req``, ``env``, ``env_nobuild``.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
- When an ``asv find`` step fails due to timeout, assume runtime equal to
  timeout to allow bisection to proceed (#768)
- Minor fixes and improvements (#897, #896, #888, #881, #877, #876, #875,
  #861, #870, #868, #867, #866, #864, #863, #857, #786, #854, #855, #852,
  #850, #844, #843, #842, #839, #841, #840, #837, #836, #834, #831, #830,
  #829, #828, #826, #825, #824)

Other Changes and Additions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Uniqueness of ``repr()`` for ``param`` objects is now guaranteed
  by suffixing unique identifier corresponding to order of
  appearance. (#771)
- Memory addresses are now stripped from the ``repr()`` of ``param``
  elements, allowing comparison across multiple runs. (#771)
- ``asv dev`` is now equivalent to ``asv run`` with ``--python=same``
  default. (#874)
- ``asv continuous`` by default now records measurement samples,
  for better comparison statistics. (#878)
- ASV now uses PEP 518 ``pyproject.toml`` in packaging. (#853)


0.4.1 (2019-05-30)
------------------

- Change wheel installation default command to chdir away from build directory
  instead of ``--force-install``. (#823)


0.4 (2019-05-26)
----------------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- ``asv check`` command for a quick check of benchmark suite validity. (#782)
- ``asv run HASHFILE:filename`` can read commit hashes to run from file or stdin (#768)

  from runs in "existing" environments not managed by asv (#794)
- ``--cpu-affinity`` option to ``asv run`` and others, to set CPU affinity (#769)
- "Hide legend" option in web UI (#807)
- ``pretty_source`` benchmark attribute for customizing source code shown (#810)
- Record number of cores in machine information (#761)

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^
- Default timer changed from ``process_time()`` to
  ``timeit.default_timer()`` to fix resolution issues on Windows.
  Old behavior can be restored by setting ``Benchmark.timer = time.process_time``
  (#780)

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^
- Fix pip command line in ``install_command`` (#806)
- Python 3.8 compatibility (#814)
- Minor fixes and improvements (#759, #764, #767, #772, #779, #783, #784, #787,
  #790, #795, #799, #804, #812, #813, #815, #816, #817, #818, #820)

Other Changes and Additions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- In case of significant changes ``asv continuous`` message now reports
  if performance decreased or increased.


0.3.1 (2018-10-20)
------------------

Minor bugfixes and improvements.

- Use measured uncertainties to weigh step detection. (#753)
- Detect also single-commit regressions, if significant. (#745)
- Use proper two-sample test when raw results available. (#754)
- Use a better regression "badness" measure. (#744)
- Display verbose command output immediately, not when command
  completes. (#747)

  benchmark discovery. (#743, #742)
- Fix forkserver child process handling.
- In asv test suite, use dummy conda packages. (#738)
- Other minor fixes (#756, #750, #749, #746)


0.3 (2018-09-09)
----------------

Major release with several new features.

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Revised timing benchmarking. ``asv`` will display and record the
  median and interquartile ranges of timing measurement results. The
  information is also used by ``asv compare`` and ``asv continuous``
  in determining what changes are significant. The ``asv run`` command
  has new options for collecting samples. Timing benchmarks have
  new benchmarking parameters for controlling how timing works,
  including  ``processes`` attribute for collect data by running
  benchmarks in different sequential processes.
  The defaults are adjusted to obtain faster benchmarking.
  (#707, #698, #695, #689, #683, #665, #652, #575, #503, #493)

- Interleaved benchmark running. Timing benchmarks can be run in
  interleaved order via ``asv run --interleave-processes``, to obtain
  better sampling over long-time background performance variations.
  (#697, #694, #647)

- Customization of build/install/uninstall commands. (#699)

- Launching benchmarks via a fork server (on Unix-based systems).
  Reduces the import time overheads in launching new
  benchmarks. Default on Linux. (#666, #709, #730)

- Benchmark versioning. Invalidate old benchmark results when
  benchmarks change, via a benchmark ``version``
  attribute. User-configurable, by default based on source
  code. (#509)

- Setting benchmark attributes on command line, via ``--attribute``.
  (#647)

- ``asv show`` command for displaying results on command line. (#711)

- Support for Conda channels. (#539)

- Provide ASV-specific environment variables to launched commands. (#624)

- Show branch/tag names in addition to commit hashes. (#705)

- Support for projects in repository subdirectories. (#611)

- Way to run specific parametrized benchmarks. (#593)

- Group benchmarks in the web benchmark grid (#557)

- Make the web interface URL addresses more copypasteable.
  (#608, #605, #580)

- Allow customizing benchmark display names (#484)

- Don't reinstall project if it is already installed (#708)

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

- The ``goal_time`` attribute in timing benchmarks is removed (and now
  ignored). See documentation on how to tune timing benchmarks now.

- ``asv publish`` may ask you to run ``asv update`` once after upgrading,
  to regenerate ``benchmarks.json`` if ``asv run`` was not yet run.

- If you are using ``asv`` plugins, check their compatibility.  The
  internal APIs in ``asv`` are not guaranteed to be backward
  compatible.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

  #723, #721, #719, #718, #716, #715, #714, #713, #706, #701, #691, #688,
  #684, #682, #660, #634, #615, #600, #573, #556)

^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Automatic detection and listing of performance regressions. (#236)
- Support for Windows. (#282)
- New ``setup_cache`` method. (#277)
- Exclude/include rules in configuration matrix. (#329)
- Command-line option for selecting environments. (#352)
- Possibility to include packages via pip in conda environments. (#373)

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

- The parent directory of the benchmark suite is no longer inserted
  into ``sys.path``. (#307)
- Repository mirrors are no longer created for local repositories. (#314)
- In asv.conf.json matrix, ``null`` previously meant (undocumented)
  the latest version. Now it means that the package is to not be
  installed. (#329)
- Previously, the ``setup`` and ``teardown`` methods were run only once
  even when the benchmark method was run multiple times, for example due
  to ``repeat > 1`` being present in timing benchmarks. This is now
  changed so that also they are run multiple times. (#316)
- The default branch for Mercurial is now ``default``, not ``tip``. (#394)
- Benchmark results are now by default ordered by commit, not by date. (#429)
- When ``asv run`` and other commands are called without specifying
  revisions, the default values are taken from the branches in
  ``asv.conf.json``. (#430)

  ``asv compare`` was changed from 2.0 to 1.1 (#469).
